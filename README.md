# Tic-Tac-Toe
The game is a two-player game. The playing area is formed of a grid of 3 by 3 cells. The first player is attributed the letter X and the second player the letter O. They each insert the attributed letter in turns. The first to insert 3 letters on a row, a column or the diagonals of the grid wins the game.
